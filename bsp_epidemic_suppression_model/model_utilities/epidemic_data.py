"""
This file contains epidemic data specific of COVID-19 used in the calculations as inputs.
Note that we normalize the "default" effective reproduction number R0 to 1, as we are only interested in the relative
suppression. On the other hand, the breakdown of R0 in components and the shape of the infectiousness beta0 are taken
from the literature, as well as the incubation period distribution.
Below we consider a "two components model", in which the infected individuals are only divided, by illness severity,
into symptomatic and asymptomatic.
The source for all the numeric values is
